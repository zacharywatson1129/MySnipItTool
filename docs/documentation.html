            <h2>Taking Screenshots</h1>
            <p>Taking a screenshot in MySnipItTool is really easy.
                There are two different types of screenshots you can take: a
                full screenshot
                or a screen snippet. Both types of screenshots can be taken 3
                different ways:
                through the menubar, through the toolbar, and through the
                context menu in the
                system tray (when the application is minimized through the file
                menu).
            </p>
            <h2>Editing Images</h2>
            <p>Editing screenshots is really easy. The drawing tools you get
                with
                MySnipItTool are the most basic drawing tools you get with any
                image
                editing software, so it's pretty simple to learn them.</p>
            <h3>Pencil</h3>
            <p>The pencil tool lets you draw free hand on the image. Just click
                and drag.</p>
            <h3>Line</h3>
            <p>The line tool lets you draw straight lines. This tool is also
                click and drag.</p>
            <h3>Rectangle</h3>
            <p>Lets you draw rectangles. The tool is click and drag.</p>
            <h3>Circle/Ellipse</h3>
            <p>This one lets you draw circles or ellipses. It's just click and
                drag.</p>
            <h3>Text</h3>
            <p>The text tool lets you type text on the image.
                Simply click where you want text, and start typing.</p>
            <h3>Eraser</h3>
            <p>A very handy tool for when you need to erase shapes, lines, or
                text.
                Just click and drag over the objects you want to erase.</p>
            <h2>Copying, Saving, and Deleting Screenshots</h2>
            <p>Once you've taken a screenshot and edited it (if need-be), you
                probably
                want to copy your screenshot or save it to your computer. Saving
                a
                screenshot is easy, and there are two ways to do it. The first
                option is
                to use the save option on the File menu. The other option is to
                use
                the toolbar button. To delete a screenshot, simply use the Red
                'X' button
                on the toolbar.
