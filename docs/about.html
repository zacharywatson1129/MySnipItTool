            <h1>About MySnipItTool</h1>

            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>MySnipItTool is a screenshot application written for Windows. 
                The program is written in C#, and the UI framework is WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). 
                Utilizing GDI+ functions originally made for Windows Forms, these native Windows functions 
                allow fast screenshot taking, but through the power of WPF, allowing easy image manipulation.</p>
            
            <h2>Goal of MySnipItTool</h2>
            <p>MySnipItTool is a free, open source screen capture application running under the MIT license. 
                Developed for Windows, it is designed to be a lightweight replacement for the Snipping Tool 
                with a few more bells and whistles than a lot of applications provide. One of the biggest goals
                is to provide a tabular interface, allowing multiple screenshots at once. This gives the user
                the ability to take multiple shots without having to save screenshots in-between, making the 
                tool much easier to use.
                The project can be found here:</p>

                <h2>Developer Goals</h2>
                <p>The goals of this project in the future are to move towards a much more modern type of interface,
                    allowing better drawing tools, a more polished set of icons, and more screenshot types. To do this,
                    MySnipItTool needs the open source community to contribute in order to make this tool a success.
                    MySnipItTool can be a useful project, and can be made into a very professional tool with the right people
                    to make it get there, so all contributions are appreciated.
                </p>
