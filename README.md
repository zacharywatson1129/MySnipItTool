If you wish to contribute to making MySnipItTool better, you are free to simply clone the project and add the feature you see fit.
The code is written in C#, and WPF is the chosen GUI framework.

## History
Originally, the code was written using the Windows Forms (Winforms) GUI framework. The problem with drawing in Winforms is its
ability to allow drawing on top of a picture--erasing will actually erase the picture, for example--so I scratched that idea and
rebuilt MySnipItTool using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). It allowed for more flexibility in improving the user interface
and adding my own custom icons.
